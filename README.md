# Requirements

Not going to lie this week, I am very disappointed in what I was able to achieve this week. I even submitted this absurdly late as I forgot to even do it. I don't really "get" next.js yet, and I still basically had no time to refine it at all.

## Posts can be sorted using query string
## Sql schema with posts and comments table
## Add comments using a user-friendly form
## Comment on posts contextually.
## Automatically redirected to posts page after posting.
## Posts can be deleted.
